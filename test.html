            <p>As you can see in this image, the names of the assignments are listed across the top of the gradebook grid, and information about the submissions is contained in the columns below the assignment name. More options appear when you hover over the column name to reveal the action button.</p>
            <p>You will see a variety of icons and number in the columns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A number means you have graded the assignment</li>
                <li>A dash means there is no submission</li>
                <li>A "paper" icon means there is a submission that hasn't been graded</li>
                <li>The color coded bubbles refers to the originality score from Turnitin</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Outside of the Gradebook, you can also view assignments that have been submitted and need grading in the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assignments in the Course Navigation Tools</li>
                <li>The "To Do" list</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="tabber-2-content" class="tabber-content">
            <p>If you view the individual assignment from the Assignments tool, you will see the following concerning submissions:</p><p><img src="https://worldclassroom.webster.edu/courses/1426594/files/68885062/preview" alt="details for grading assignments" width="876" height="186" data-ally-user-updated-alt="details for grading assignments" data-api-endpoint="https://worldclassroom.webster.edu/api/v1/courses/1426594/files/68885062" data-api-returntype="File" data-id="68885062"><button class="ally-accessibility-score-indicator ally-accessibility-score-indicator-high

            <ul>
                <li>Current number of submissions</li>
                <li>Number of submissions that have already been graded by you</li>
                <li>Access to SpeedGrader</li>
                <li>Link to download the assignment submissions (if desired)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Notes on Discussions/Participation Grades</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>If your discussions are set to be individually graded, you will see a grading icon next to the discussion in the list. You will also see a column in the grade book for the individual discussions. To grade the discussions, go to SpeedGrader (from the individual discussion or from the grade book) to view all of the responses submitted by the student.</li>
                <li>Some courses give a more cumulative-type grade for the week or for several weeks. You should be able to find the column in the grade book and you can add the grade manually.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Quizzes</strong></p>
            <p>Quizzes that have been taken by students can be viewed from the Quizzes tool or through the grade book in a manner similar to the one listed above. To review student submissions through the Quizzes tool, click on the quiz then click on the &ldquo;<em>Moderate this Quiz</em>&rdquo; button on the right side of the screen.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><img src="https://worldclassroom.webster.edu/courses/1426594/files/68885117/preview" alt="grading on quizzes" width="761" height="202" data-ally-user-updated-alt="grading on quizzes" data-api-endpoint="https://worldclassroom.webster.edu/api/v1/courses/1426594/files/68885117" data-api-returntype="File" data-id="68885117"></p>
                <p>Students who have taken the quiz will have their names appear as links so you can go directly to that submission. Objective type exams will be automatically graded by the system while any short answer or paragraph assessments will need to be manually graded by you. You will be able to see the answers to all of their questions as well as change the grade, if necessary, from this location.</p>
                <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to create columns in the Gradebook, this must be done by adding an assignment on the assignment index page.</li>
                <li>We recommend that you export your Gradebook at the beginning of the term right after students are loaded so you have an original version of your class list. If students drop or withdraw, they will disappear from the Gradebook.</li>
                <li>When the Gradebook has more columns than can fit on the screen, the horizontal scroll bar will appear at the bottom of the Gradebook page. The students&rsquo; names, Secondary ID, and notes (if visible) columns will remain frozen to the left on the Gradebook screen.</li>
                <li>Instructors can view courses in Student View. When instructors view the course in Student View, they can submit assignments as the Test Student. A row for the Test Student will appear at the bottom of the gradebook screen. Test Student scores are not included in course statistics.</li>
