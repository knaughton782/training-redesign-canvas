        <p>Go to the Profile and Settings area now to get these set-up. Remember to add a short bio and a picture (either of you or something that represents you/Webster). Next move on to Notifications and get those ready for when students are trying to connect with you. All of these settings are for your account in WorldClassRoom and will be available no matter the class you are teaching.</p>
