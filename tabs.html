As with any app, not all features will be as available as they will be on a regular computer.<img src="https://worldclassroom.webster.edu/courses/1426594/files/68749300/download?wrap=1" alt="canvas_app" data-api-endpoint="https://worldclassroom.webster.edu/api/v1/courses/1426594/files/68749300" data-api-returntype="File" data-id="68749300"><button class="ally-accessibility-score-indicator ally-accessibility-score-indicator-perfect

            <p>You are not responsible for all of the technical issues that students encounter. The general rule of thumb is this: If everyone in the class is having a technical issue with, say a video, then the issue is probably on our (the OLC) part and you should contact us or the IT Service desk to see if we can remedy the problem. If only individual students are having issues, then you should send them to the IT Service desk, where there are people trained to troubleshoot technical issues on individual computers.</p>

This can be the same or different from the instructor introduction page that will go into individual courses. You can also upload a picture (click on the circle or pencil icon) of yourself or something that represents you or Webster University. Adding these items helps to initiate the feeling of community with students so that they know at the start that you are a qualified individual (i.e. a real person) who will be part of their learning success.&amp;nbsp;Personalization is an important concept that encourages a successful learning environment for your student. The students are curious about you and your background as it relates to their program of study. It is important to set up your profile now so that it will be easily accessible to students. Uploading your picture and creating a short biography now will ensure that students in all of your future classes will have access to this information.</p></div>

                <div><li>The email address on your profile which by default is your Webster email address</li></div>

Point the mouse under the email or mobile number column to set your desired preferences for each activity. Review the list below for more detailed description of each option. At a minimum, we recommend that you set up notifications for the following activities in your courses:</p></div>
                <div><ul></div>
                <div><li>Announcement Created by You - this will send you a notification if a student responds to one of your Announcements</li></div>
                <div><li>Invitation - for courses, conferences, groups</li></div>
                <div><li>All Submissions - for assignment submissions<br />Submission Comments - so you can be notified if a student responds to your assignment comments.</li></div>
                <div><li>Discussion and Discussion Post - you may not want to do this for the entire term as students could be posting at all hours of the night. Consider "subscribing" to certain discussions if you really want to know when students respond. More on this in the tool training.</li></div>
                <div><li>Conversations - this one is crucial so you can be aware at all times that students are trying to get in touch with you.</li></div>
                <div></ul></div>
                <div><p><strong>Note:</strong> Your students will be adjusting their profile as well so it is important that you stress to them that they adjust their notification preferences accordingly.</p></div>
