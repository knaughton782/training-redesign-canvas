<p>Welcome to the Webster University Online Faculty training course. Please view the short introductory video below. You can expand to full screen if needed.</p>

<p>Welcome to Online learning at webster university. We&rsquo;re glad you are taking the time to learn more about online teaching and learning before you start to teach your first online course. You may have a lot of questions as you start this adventure so we will try to address some of the basic questions in this video and then continue to provide information throughout this training course.</p>
<p>The course is structured in a sequential order so please complete in that manner. The system will be tracking your progress through each of the four modules. For example, this module will not be marked as complete until you view EVERY page. This also means that the next module will NOT open until you have completed the previous module.</p>

<p>Maybe teaching online is not entirely new to you or maybe, just maybe, this is your very first time teaching, ever. We are all here to help. This course is meant to be interactive with teachers collaborating and sharing throughout the course so you will find a few discussions where you can share and ask questions. You&rsquo;ll find the first one within this module.<br />The course is very easy to follow but be forewarned, there is no quick and easy version of learning how to be the best online instructor. We start you out now, with about a month to go before your students are loaded, because time and again, we have heard back from instructors that they want to know what they need to know WHEN they need to know it.</p>

<p>The Online Learning Center at Webster University is comprised of 3 teams that provide support for instructors and students: Student Success, Support, Training and technology and creative services. Student services handles all the student training and support, Creative services designs the online courses and the STT team provides support to instructors as they teach while supporting the underlying technology. Your current training experience is designed and delivered by the Support Training and Technology team. But did you know that we have a team of instructional and course designers that have worked with the author of your course to present the content and assessments in the best way to create an ideal learning environment for students. The only missing part is you!</p>

<p>We know that "training" is not always a welcome word so we want to clarify that this course is designed to help you be the best online instructor that you can be for our students. Student success is the goal of everything that we do here at Webster University. The Online Learning Center is the focal point for learning about how to support student success and YOU are one of the key figures. Research has shown that an involved, engaged instructor can make the difference with students and we are here today to provide information and strategies to help you.</p>

<p>The second module, after this welcome, will focus on instructor presence in an online course &ndash; what is it, why is it important, and some actual ways on how you achieve it. Webster would like for you to be engaged with your students and the Federal Government requires it in order to provide Title 4 assistance. It CAN be done and we will show you how! Would you think that it is even possible to know your individual students in an asynchronous course? It is, trust us! But it&rsquo;s up to you to craft your communication plan for the course. Don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; we&rsquo;ll help with that.</p>

<p>The third module focuses on technology, because after all, you will need to use it. Many people tell us that they are "just not that good" at technology. Well, you don't have to be THAT good, but you do need to learn how to do a few things. Where would you land on a technical readiness scale? Can you update your browser? Do you know how to follow a link? Have you ever used our learning management system, Canvas? Are you willing to learn how to create short videos to connect with students?</p>
<p>We will work on getting you started using Canvas tools right away and give examples of how to use them effectively in teaching. PS If you don&rsquo;t know how to update your browser, Google &ldquo;how do I update my browser?&rdquo; Beyond Canvas, we will talk a bit about some tools that are available to you within Canvas such as Kaltura for making videos, Ally for increasing accessibility in your course and Concourse for providing a Webster University style syllabus.</p>

<p>The fourth module in this training will focus on the application of the practices and skills you have learned thus far. It is extremely important for you to take the time before students are loaded to prepare the course for students. Even though we work on a Master/Clone module, and there is much more on this on the following pages, there are things for you to do show your presence in the course from Day One of the term.</p>

<p>The final module covers some administrative details that you may not know about already, and frankly, may not care about just yet. We understand that we are presenting a lot of material in this training. But please do take the time to review the module where we will show you the Student Success Portal that is used for reporting student issues, provide a list of services that we provide for students, and give you ideas on how we support all of our students.</p>

<p>And now to get us started learning together, here's the first threaded discussion.

        <p>Discussions provide learners an opportunity to participate in virtual conversations at any time and any location. Most of our online courses have weekly discussion assignments that have already been created for students to answer. Students are asked to post their answer, read the other postings and reply to their classmates with the goal of furthering the conversation and learning from others.</p>
