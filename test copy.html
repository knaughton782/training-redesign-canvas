<h2 class="training-md">A Different Pedagogical Approach</h2>




<p class="bs">Live Virtual is a term used by Webster University to label a pedagogical approach that in some circles is called Flipped Learning. Flipped Learning is a pedagogical model in which the initial contact with new concepts does not take place in a physical classroom space, but rather in an individual’s own learning space, where students complete structured activities on their own time at their convenience. In Live Virtual, the real-time "group" space, the virtual classroom, is transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where the instructor will guide students as they apply concepts and engage creatively in the subject matter. So, Live Virtual is an instructional strategy that involves both active learning with a blended learning approach.</p>

<div class="callout">
    <p>What determines flipped learning is not the technology being used but
        what activities take place in the individual (offline) versus group (online, synchronous) spaces that students encounter.<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p class="center-emphasis bs">One of the key elements of Live Virtual is for you, as the instructor, to <i>Provide an opportunity for students to gain first exposure to the topics PRIOR to class.</i></p>

<p>The materials that are provided in the online portion of the class have been created and curated with direct connection to the learning objectives and competencies that have been set by your department. The textual information, images, tables, and videos have been intentionally designed to ensure that students gain knowledge about the topics<em>before </em>you meet in class. Have you ever noticed how difficult it is to have an in-class discussion about a complex topic when the students just learned about it 30 minutes before?</p>
<p>Live Virtual at Webster provides the opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Change the learning environment to better serve students</li>
    <li>Better prepare students for later courses (that require the ability to apply concepts)</li>
    <li>Increase a student's ability to engage in deep discussions during the face-to-face meetings</li>
    <li>Encourage students to enter the class meeting more prepared for an active and engaged learning environment</li>
</ul>
