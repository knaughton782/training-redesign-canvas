            <p>Interactions between students can include social as well as course related collaborations. Social interaction in the very beginning of the course can increase student's comfort and trust with each other and with the environment. These types of interactions set the stage for the development of your learning community.</p>
            <p>Student-to-student interaction-based activities can include:</p>
            <div  style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>Discussions and debates</li>
                    <li>Working on a collaborative document</li>
                    <li>Working as a group on projects or case studies</li>
                    <li>Peer reviews of selected work</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>These types of examples can be used for project groups doing research and presentations or maybe a discussion question where students brainstorm alternatives to a problem posed by you or the textbook.</p>

            <p>Student-to-instructor interaction can include both direct instruction (think: instructional notes and demos) and other more informal mentoring and support. <strong>Regular and substantive student-to-instructor interaction</strong> is required for courses to be classified as "online courses" and not "correspondence courses" by the <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=45333f1baff1fb4eb6289b4caaf4ed50&amp;amp;mc=true&amp;amp;node=se34.3.600_12&amp;amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Department of Education</a> and the <a href="https://hlcommission.org/Monitoring/distance-delivery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Higher Learning Commission</a>.</p>

            <p>Some ideas for student-to-instructor interaction that can be built into the course include:</p>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>Incorporate the opportunity for instructors to provide feedback on assignments and activities</li>
                    <li>Include expectations for students that instructors will be participating in discussions</li>
                    <li>Create some example announcements for instructors to use so they can posting regular and frequent announcements to summarize previous week or prep for the next week</li>
                    <li>Providing instructions for incorporating virtual office hours</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="training-thin">Student to Content</h3>

            <p>Student-to-content interaction includes students' actual interactions with the instructional materials as well as their more abstract interactions with the concepts and ideas presented. It is more than just reading the chapters or watching a YouTube video. Interaction with the content can happen when:</p>

            <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>Tutorials (using text, still images, audio, and/ or video) are present for the students to consume</li>
                    <li>Formative quizzes are incorporated and include useful and usable feedback</li>
                    <li>Clear and detailed directions are given to investigate a topic on the Internet</li>
                    <li>Reflections on required reading or watching a required resource</li>
                    <li>Simulations and scenarios are included to help student understanding of a topic</li>
                </ul>
