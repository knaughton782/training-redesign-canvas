        <p>This is the end of the second module where you learned all about creating an instructor presence in an online course. You were introduced to tools such as announcements, discussions, video, and the rich content editor. You can use your tool training sections to practice these skills if you don't have access to your live section yet.</p>

        <p>You have reached the end of the first module, Introduction to Training. By now you should have a good idea of how the Live Virtual courses will be presented. Now we will move on to the parts where you, the instructor, come directly into the picture.</p>

        <p>The next module, <b>Key Teaching Strategies</b>, will provide a plethora of strategies that you can use to engage and interact with your students in the LIVE part of your course. This is the part when you all come together, after the students have been exposed to "lecture" and other content that would normally be delivered in the "Sage on the Stage" model of teaching. In Live Virtual, that content is delivered via the weekly modules in WorldClassRoom/Canvas and now it is time for you to use all of your magical teaching skills to enhance the understanding the students need to master the topics for the week.</p>

        <p>Any questions so far? Please contact your training partner.</p>
